# 3D Modeling & Animation

I used Blender as my main tools, sometimes I used 3ds Max instead.

Feel free to visit my Sketchfab: <https://sketchfab.com/mopackp>.

## Character Modeling

* I make 3d characters by using these methods: Mesh Editing, Sculpting, Material & Texture Mapping, Rigging, Weight Paint, Animation (Keyframe & Shape Keys).
